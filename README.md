## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Js

### What I learned

I for the first time build a whole landing page for the first time and got to know a lot about padding and grid and how we can use this two plus coreect fonts unit to make the whole page responsive. Also learnt about how to build navigaton drop-down for mobile version.

### Continued development

I would like to bring animation in how the drop-down menu appears in front of user.
